melanoma_diagnosis:
  description: >
    Analyze a skin lesion {image} using the 7-point checklist methodology for melanoma diagnosis. 
    This diagnostic framework evaluates specific dermatoscopic criteria categorized as major and minor. 
    The task involves:
    - Identifying major criteria: atypical pigment network, blue-white veil, and atypical vascular pattern.
    - Identifying minor criteria: irregular streaks, irregular pigmentation, irregular dots and globules, and regression structures.
    - Scoring each identified feature according to the checklist (3 points for major criteria, 1 point for minor criteria).
    - Summarizing the total score and providing a diagnostic interpretation based on established thresholds.

    The goal is to deliver a structured and evidence-based diagnosis of the lesion, helping clinicians assess malignancy risk accurately.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report including:
    - Identification of the 7 dermatoscopic criteria present in the lesion.
    - A numerical score for each criterion.
    - The total score for the lesion.
    - A diagnostic interpretation (e.g., "Low risk of melanoma," "Moderate risk of melanoma," or "High risk of melanoma") 
      based on the score thresholds:
        - <3 points: Low risk
        - 3-4 points: Moderate risk
        - â‰¥5 points: High risk

medical_diagnosis_summary:
  description: >
    Summarize the results provided by the diagnostic, prognostic, and imaging agents 
    into a cohesive and actionable final report. The summary should include:
    - Diagnostic Overview: A synthesis of the findings from the diagnostic agent, including 
      identified criteria from the 7-point checklist and their respective scores.
    - Prognostic Evaluation: Insights from the prognostic agent regarding the likelihood 
      of melanoma and risk categorization based on the total score.
    - Imaging Observations: Key patterns and markers identified by the imaging analysis agent.
    - Overall Assessment: A high-level summary of the combined insights, including 
      key takeaways and next-step recommendations.
      
    The report should be formatted in a clear and structured manner, suitable for 
    medical professionals or stakeholders reviewing the case. Each section should 
    clearly delineate the source of the insights and present them in an easily 
    understandable format.
  expected_output: >
    A well-structured summary report containing:
    - A Diagnostic Overview with identified features and a cumulative score.
    - A Prognostic Evaluation highlighting risk categorization and potential outcomes.
    - Imaging Observations detailing key markers and abnormalities.
    - A concise Overall Assessment combining all findings with clear recommendations 
      for potential next steps or follow-ups.
